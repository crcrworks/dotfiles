# Asking Effective Questions

Guidance for using the `askuserquestion` tool effectively. Load this skill before 
asking questions to ensure you gather useful information.

## Core Principles

### 1. Context First, Questions Second

ALWAYS analyze the project before asking:

1. Check package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt for existing choices
2. Look for existing patterns in the codebase
3. Identify what's ALREADY decided vs genuinely ambiguous
4. Consider what you can reasonably infer

**DON'T ask about decisions already made.**

### 2. Quality Over Quantity

- Maximum 4-6 questions per interaction
- Each question should unlock meaningful progress
- Combine related questions when possible
- Skip questions where you can make a reasonable default

### 3. Options With Tradeoffs

Each option MUST include context:

**BAD**:
```
Database: PostgreSQL | MongoDB | SQLite
```

**GOOD**:
```
Database:
- PostgreSQL (you have complex relationships, ACID needed)
- MongoDB (flexible schema, your data is document-shaped)  
- SQLite (simple needs, single-user, no ops overhead)
```

## When NOT to Ask

Skip questions when:

1. **The answer is in the code** - check first
2. **Either choice works fine** - make a reasonable default
3. **It's easily changeable** - just pick one and note it
4. **You're just avoiding a decision** - trust your judgment
5. **The question is premature** - wait until you need the answer

## Question Templates

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for templates:
- Technology Choice
- Scope Clarification  
- UX Decision
- Architecture Decision

## Anti-Patterns

See [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) for what to avoid:
- Generic questions without context
- Asking about decided things
- Yes/No when options exist
- Overwhelming with too many questions

## Examples

See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for:
- Good example: Authentication feature
- Good example: API design
- Bad examples with corrections

## Reasoning Template

Before presenting questions, think through:

1. What do I already know from the codebase?
2. What am I actually uncertain about?
3. Which uncertainties matter RIGHT NOW?
4. Can I make reasonable defaults for any of these?
5. For remaining questions, what are the REAL tradeoffs?
